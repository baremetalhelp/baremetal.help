1. ... TBD

## The result

You'll have the following resources
1. A fully-working documentation site from a standard template.
1. The ability to run and make changes locally, where you can see changes immediately.
1. A bash command to publish the site to GitHub Pages [link]. 
1. Instructions for setting up GitHub Pages in your repo. (You can do this on the command line with a bit of setup. Sometimes click-ops is simpler.)
1. DNS entries that GitHub Pages require to point your domain at the right repo and branch.

## Resources

Blah.
